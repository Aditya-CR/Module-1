Write a C program to calculate the slope and the midpoint of a line using its end points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

During execution, the program should print the following messages one by one on the console:
Enter x and y coordinates of Endpoint-1 : 
Enter x and y coordinates of Endpoint-2 : 
For example, if the user gives the input as:
Enter x and y coordinates of Endpoint-1 : 2.5 3.5
Enter x and y coordinates of Endpoint-2 : 3.5 4.5
Then the program should print the result as:
The given endpoints of a line are : (2.500000, 3.500000) and (3.500000, 4.500000)
Slope : 1.000000
Midpoint : (3.000000, 4.000000)
Note: Use the printf() function with a newline character (\n) at the end.
