# Module-1
In C, there are two types of comments:
1.	end-of-line comment : It starts with //. The content that follows the // and continues till the end of that line is a comment. It is also called as single-line comment.
2.	traditional comment : It starts with /* and ends with */. The content between /* and */ is the comment. It is also called as multi-line comment.
Given below are 3 important points regarding comments:
1.	There should not be any space between the two forward slashes in //, i.e., / / is incorrect. Similarly, there should not be any space between the slash and star characters in /* and */, i.e., / * and * / are incorrect.
2.	Comments do not nest, i.e., /* and */ comment has no special meaning inside a // comment.Similarly, a // comment has no special meaning inside a /* comment.
3.	One should not write comments inside character literals (i.e., characters enclosed between single-quotes). Comments inside String literals (i.e., text enclosed between double-quotes) are treated as part of the String's content.
