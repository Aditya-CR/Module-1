Write a program to read two integers from standard input and to print the sum of the two given integers on the standard output.

During execution, the program should print the following message on the console:
Enter two integer values : 
For example, if the user gives the input as:
Enter two integer values : 3 4
then the program should print the result as:
The sum of given numbers = 7
Note - 1 : Use '\n' at the end while printing the final output using printf().

Note - 2 : getchar() is used to read only one character at a time, where as scanf() can read multiple data type values at a time.
